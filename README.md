# OPT-convogpt
## Now with 3D Tensor Support!
This is an updated version of convogpt that I've modified to run OPT models. It can also run any other LLM pytorch model with just 2 lines of code being changed to whatever model you're using.

Aside from this, it is now able to get repeated inputs instead of running once and outputting a value.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pretrained Models
| Model ID   | Parameter Count | Training Method |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| [350]([https://huggingface.co/hakurei/convogpt/tree/main/125m-uft](https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-350m)) | Basic and for testing setups.|
| [2.7b]([https://huggingface.co/hakurei/convogpt/tree/main/1.3b-uft](https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-2.7b)) | The standard and well preforming base.|
| [6.7b]([https://huggingface.co/hakurei/convogpt/tree/main/2.7b-uft](https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-6.7b)) | If you're able, use this model. |
| [66b]([https://huggingface.co/hakurei/convogpt/tree/main/6b-uft](https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-66b))     | This is a massive model, it will NOT run on any consumer hardware. Don't download this unless you know what you're doing.|

## üîë Setup

```shell
git clone git@github.com:harubaru/convogpt.git
cd convogpt
pip install protobuf==3.20.*
